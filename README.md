# StakeStar Contracts

## Development agreements

- all changes should be made in a separate branch and submitted through a pull request to `main`
- all version updates should be made in a unified manner using `yarn bump`
- all releases should have release notes

## To do

- add basic tests for all contracts
- add very detailed tests for rate
- add commission logic
- 2 tokens instead of one?
- use mulDiv from openZeppelin
