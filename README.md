# StakeStar Contracts

## Development agreements

- all changes should be made in a separate branch and submitted through a pull request to `main`
- all version updates should be made in a unified manner using `yarn bump`
- all releases should have release notes

## To do

 - use fullmath.mulDiv for precision
 - create library with constants?
 - add basic tests for all contracts
 - add very detailed tests for rate
 - add commission logic
 - 2 tokens instead of one?
